I want to build a checkout computer program for store owners. 
I'd like to be able to figure out the total price in the program, 
send that amount to a credit card reader, 
have the reader carry out the transaction, 
and then report to my application that the transaction was successful or failed.

Only if you have experience with it developing software.

communicating that information with the credit card reader
